KINDLY READ ALL THE NOTES IF YOU WANT TO TRY THIS YOURSELF!

1.) CHECK PROJECT PROPERTIES
	- UNDER CONFIGURATION PROPERTIES -> GENERAL
		- CONFIG TYPE = APPLICATION
		- PLATFORM TOOLSET = VISUAL STUDIO 2022
		- SDK VERSION = LATEST(10.0 ON MY COMPUTER)
		- C++ LANG STD = ISO C++ 17 STANDARD

	- UNDER CONFIGURATION PROPERTIES -> VC++ DIRECTORIES
		- INCLUDE DIRECTORIES SHOULD HAVE THE CORRECT DIRECTORY TO OPENCV\BUILD\INCLUDE
		- LIBRARY DIRECTORIES SHOULD HAVE THE CORRECT DIRECTORY TO OPENCV\BUILD\X64\VC16\LIB
	- THE OPENCV FOLDER IS ALREADY IN THE REPOSITORY!
	- YOUR ENVIRONMENT VARIABLE PATH SHOULD INCLUDE THOSE FOLDERS AS WELL!!!!! *VERY IMPORTANT!!!!*
		- ENV VAR PATH SHOULD INCLUDE X64\VC16\LIB AND X64\VC16\BIN
2.) STILL UNDER PROJECT PROPERTIES
	- UNDER LINKER SETTINGS -> INPUT
		- ADDITIONAL DEPENDENCIES SHOULD BE UNCHANGED, BUT IF SO, COPY THESE LINES
		opencv_world4100d.lib;
		opencv_world4100.lib;
		legacy_stdio_definitions.lib;

3.) CHECK ASM FILE PROPERTIES
	- CUSTOM BUILD TOOL IS ON
	- CUSTOM BUILD TOOL SHOULD INDICATE NASM DIRECTORY IN COMMAND LINE

**** YOU SHOULD BE GOOD ****

LIMITATIONS:
1. KINDLY PUT ALL TRAINING IMAGES IN THE TRAININGIMAGES FOLDER, AND NUMBER THEM STARTING FROM 1. IMAGES SHOULD BE IN JPG FORMAT
2. THE FIVE ADJUSTABLE VALUES ARE PLACED AT THE START OF THE CODE LABELLED WITH #DEFINES

!!!!!!!!!! KINDLY ADJUST THESE VALUES ONLY !!!!!!!!!!!
TRSIZE = NUMBER OF TRAINING IMAGES YOU WANT - MULTIPLES OF 4 ONLY!!!

WIDTH = HEIGHT = SIZE OF THE IMAGES YOU WANT TO SCALE THEM DOWN INTO!!! DEFAULT IS 128X128

(DO NOT CHANGE UNNECESSARILY. IF SO, CHANGE TO MULTIPLES OF 32! AND ALSO WIDTH == HEIGHT)

PRECISION = PRECISION OF THE VALUES, DEFAULT IS 1E-4. 1E-5 MAY TAKE LONG ON C++ BUT LESS THAN A MINUTE IN ASM MODE

SETTING = TRUE IF ASM MODE, FALSE IF C++ MODE
